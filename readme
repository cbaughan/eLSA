eLSA installation using conda 

By Christina Guerrero

Update 5/14/25: Create a conda environment using micromamba instead of conda  

 

I recommend getting familiar with basic Linux commands.  

 

Log in to the UArizona HPC. 

If you don’t have an account, follow the link for HPC registration instructions and use Paul Carini’s email (paulcarini@arizona.edu) as your sponsor. 

Open a terminal and connect to the Elgato cluster. 

Use SSH or Open OnDemand as appropriate. 

Example 

A computer screen with green text

Description automatically generated 

 

You can also go to terminal using Open on Demand.  

Files -> Home Directory >_Open in Terminal  

	Once you’re in the terminal, switch to the Elgato cluster by typing ’elgato’ 

Start an interactive session: 

 

(elgato) [christinagb@wentletrap ~]$ interactive -a paulcarini 

Load micromamba and initialize it if you haven't already: 

 

module load micromamba/ 
micromamba shell init -s bash -r ~/micromamba 
source ~/.bashrc 

 

Create the micromamba environment in the group storage: 

 

micromamba create --prefix /groups/paulcarini/envs/charade python=2.7 

 

Activate the environment 

Micromamba activate charade 

 

Clone the eLSA repository from your GitHub: 

git clone https://github.com/cbaughan/eLSA.git 

cd eLSA 

Check to make sure we have the correct version of Python  

python –version 

Should be Python 2.7.15 

Run the installation script 

Sbatch install_elsa.sh 

 

Summary: 

You must use git clone to get the full, editable, and up-to-date version of the files you prepared for the HPC. 

All environment management should be done with micromamba, not conda. 

If there is an error check the files to see if they need to be updated to micromamba 

Always activate the environment before running any installation or analysis scripts.
